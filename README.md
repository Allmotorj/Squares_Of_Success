## HOW TO PLAY

Each of the 100 squares is an available wagering space, labeled 0-9 on both sides. The price of each square is determined by the game's host, but is usually pretty low since this is usually a friendly contest. Once all the squares are sold, the boxes are assigned, usually at random to give the bet some parity.

Gather a group of players and ask each person to pay a set amount of money to enter the game. Assign teams and score numbers to a 10x10 grid, then have players bet on 1 square on the grid. Whoever's numbers matches the scores for each quarter wins!
